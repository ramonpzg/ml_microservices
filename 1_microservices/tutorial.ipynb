    "for more traditional software development use cases and for machine learning microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are microservices?**\n",
    "Microservices are an architectural approach to building applications as a collection of small, modular, \n",
    "independently deployable services. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are machine learning microservices?**\n",
    "Machine learning microservices apply this approach to ML systems by decomposing them into smaller \n",
    "services that each focus on a specific capability or model. Some examples of machine learning microservices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Training Service - Handles training ML models on new data.\n",
    "- Model Serving Service - Deploys trained models and provides predictions/inferences. \n",
    "- Data Processing Pipeline - Microservices for data ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing.\n",
    "- Model Monitoring Service - Tracks model performance and drift.\n",
    "- Experiment Tracking Service - Logs model experiments and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using microservices for machine learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent scaling - Can allocate more resources to demanding services.\n",
    "- Fault isolation - If one service fails, others are not affected.\n",
    "- Flexible deployment - Can rapidly deploy updates to individual services.\n",
    "- Polyglot support - Mix languages/frameworks within services.\n",
    "- Organizational alignment - Teams can own discrete services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenges are the added complexity of distributed systems and the need for coordination \n",
    "between services. Clear communication protocols and well-defined APIs are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, microservices enable faster iteration and more robust and resilient ML systems, but require \n",
    "more up-front design and infrastructure coordination."

    "- HTML: HTML is a markup language for building websites.\n",
    "- Tailwind CSS: a powerful CSS framework for building responsive websites.\n",
    "- Gradio: Gradio allows you to customize user interface by adding input fields, sliders, buttons, and more. It makes it easy for others to consume your code and interact with it in a way that suits their needs.\n",

    "Here's an attempt to describe the front-end and back-end of a microservices application using analogies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The front-end is like a traveler exploring a foreign city, navigating between sites and activities. It acts as the user interface, calling different services to assemble experiences. The React/Angular UI is the traveler's map, guiding them between locations. Redux/Flux stores are travel journals, recording visits to services. APIs are transit systems, with protocols like GraphQL as subway maps. User auth is visa security, granting access privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The back-end is like a bustling marketplace, full of vendors running independent shops. Services are merchant stalls, focused on specific capabilities. Data pipelines act as supply chains, moving inventory between stalls. Monitoring services are the market inspector, checking goods and stall conditions. APIs are the signboards and directions that connect the marketplace. Scaling changes the number of vendor stalls. New capabilities are added by launching new pop-up shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "To travel the market (use the app), the front-end explorer (UI) relies on the directions (APIs) to visit the right merchants (services). Back-end organization and protocols enable smooth exploration. Microservices create a thriving software bazaar!\n",
    "\n",

    "To run a server with FastAPI we need to use uvicorn or gunicorn. The reason for this is that FastAPI applications need a specialized ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server to run and to handle concurrent connections efficiently. ASGI servers can handle asynchronous request processing, allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously without blocking the execution flow, which is of high importance for high-performance web applications, APIs, and services.\n",

    "2. **Gunicorn:** Gunicorn is a production-ready ASGI server that can handle high loads and is suitable for deploying demanding applications. Gunicorn provides more configuration options and allows you to scale your application across multiple worker processes or even multiple server instances behind a load balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a FastAPI application using Gunicorn, you can use the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```\n",
    "gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app\n",
    "```\n",

    "When testing your FastAPI app with pytest, you can write various types of tests to ensure that different aspects of your application are working correctly. Here are some types of tests you can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test individual functions or methods in isolation to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "   - For example, you can test the function that fetches jokes from the `pyjokes` library to ensure it returns valid jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test the interactions between different components of your app.\n",
    "   - For FastAPI apps, this can involve testing how different endpoints interact and whether the data flow between them is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Endpoint Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test each endpoint of your API to ensure they handle various input scenarios correctly and return the expected responses.\n",
    "   - Use pytest fixtures to mock HTTP requests and test different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and request payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test how your app handles different types of errors, such as invalid requests or server errors.\n",
    "   - Ensure that appropriate error responses (with correct status codes and error messages) are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test security features, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n",
    "   - Ensure that unauthenticated users cannot access protected endpoints and that authorized users can access them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test the performance of your app by simulating a large number of requests and measuring response times.\n",
    "   - Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize your code or infrastructure as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Edge Case Tests:**\n",
    "   - Test your app with edge cases, such as empty inputs, boundary values, or unexpected data formats.\n",
    "   - Ensure your app behaves correctly and gracefully in these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Persistence Tests (if applicable):**\n",
    "   - If your app interacts with a database, test database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "   - Use fixtures to set up and tear down test data for database-related tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing tests, consider using pytest fixtures to create reusable setup code for your tests. Also, utilize the `requests` library in combination with pytest to send HTTP requests to your app's endpoints and validate the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By covering these different aspects of your FastAPI app with tests, you can increase your confidence in its correctness, reliability, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how you can write tests for your FastAPI app using pytest, covering different testing approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Unit Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a utility function in a module called `utils.py` that fetches jokes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# utils.py\n",
    "import pyjokes\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_random_joke():\n",
    "    return pyjokes.get_joke()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write a unit test for this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_utils.py\n",
    "from utils import get_random_joke\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_get_random_joke():\n",
    "    joke = get_random_joke()\n",
    "    assert isinstance(joke, str)\n",
    "    assert len(joke) > 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Integration Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For integration tests, you can test the interactions between different components of your app. Here's an example using FastAPI's `TestClient`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_integration.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",
    "from main import app\n",
    "\n",
    "client = TestClient(app)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_get_joke_endpoint():\n",
    "    response = client.get(\"/joke\")\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 200\n",
    "    data = response.json()\n",
    "    assert \"joke\" in data\n",
    "    assert isinstance(data[\"joke\"], str)\n",
    "    assert len(data[\"joke\"]) > 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Endpoint Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write tests for specific endpoints, verifying their behavior for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_endpoints.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",
    "from main import app\n",
    "\n",
    "client = TestClient(app)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_get_joke_endpoint():\n",
    "    response = client.get(\"/joke\")\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 200\n",
    "    data = response.json()\n",
    "    assert \"joke\" in data\n",
    "    assert isinstance(data[\"joke\"], str)\n",
    "    assert len(data[\"joke\"]) > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add more endpoint tests as needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Error Handling Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test how your app handles errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_error_handling.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",
    "from main import app\n",
    "\n",
    "client = TestClient(app)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_invalid_endpoint():\n",
    "    response = client.get(\"/invalid_endpoint\")\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 404\n",
    "    assert response.json() == {\"detail\": \"Not Found\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add more error handling tests as needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Security Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test authentication and authorization mechanisms (assuming your app has authentication logic):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_security.py\n",
    "from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n",
    "from main import app\n",
    "\n",
    "client = TestClient(app)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_authenticated_endpoint():\n",
    "    # Assuming you have authentication logic and obtain a token\n",
    "    headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer <your_token>\"}\n",
    "    response = client.get(\"/authenticated_endpoint\", headers=headers)\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 200\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_unauthenticated_endpoint():\n",
    "    response = client.get(\"/authenticated_endpoint\")\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 401\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are basic examples to get you started. Depending on your app's complexity, you might need more elaborate tests and additional libraries (such as `pytest-mock` for mocking) to handle specific scenarios. Make sure to structure your tests based on your application's architecture and requirements."
